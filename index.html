<b><p>Insperation!</b><br>
So Guys I(The Creator) got the insperation from an anime named Buddyfight! and a yt channel called ChaosGalaxyTCG and videos related to TCG (Trading card games).</p>
<b><p>About the creator!<br></p></b>
<p>So <b>FutureMon Fight</b> was created by a 12 year old indian boy named Nalin Mathur(Me). I started making tcgs when i was 9 or 10,i made my 1st tcg and its name was <b>"Dragon world era"</b> but that was a failure. Then i made another tcg which was names <b>"Oh no!"</b> which was like a cheaper version of <b>UNO</b> card game. But when i started make another tcg 1st i make the card packs and i never made cards for it because it would be a waste of paper but when i made the logo i named it <b>"Monster Fight"</b> then after 1 or 2 months i started another tcg which was the beginning of FutureMon fight i took some ideas from my old tcgs i made like dragon world era, oh no! and Monster fight and i made ton of cards. So, i decided to make this card successful. Now about me so i was watching  <b>Buddyfight</b> which was my 1st insperation i luved that anime and decided to make these tcgs then i watched a youtube channel named <b>ChaosGalaxyTCG</b> and started to make myself some tcgs. Thats about me.<b>CHECK OUT, THE OTHER THINGS BELOW!!</b> </p>
